## Features

### Vocabulary Tracker
- Add, edit, and delete vocabulary entries with Japanese word, English meaning, reading, JLPT level, and notes
- Search and filter by JLPT level (N5–N1)
- Sort by date, alphabetical order, or JLPT level
- Duplicate detection to prevent re-adding existing words

### Kanji Tracker
- Track individual kanji characters with meanings, readings, and JLPT levels
- Search and filter functionality matching the vocabulary tracker
- Visual kanji character display with consistent styling

### Resource Progress Tracker
- Monitor textbooks, workbooks, grammar books, and custom learning resources
- Track completion progress with unit-based tracking (Lessons, Chapters, Pages, etc.)
- Progress bars showing percentage completion
- Pre-loaded with popular resources (Minna no Nihongo, Shin Nihongo 500, Basic Kanji 320)

### JLPT Progress Roadmap
- Visual roadmap from N5 (Beginner) to N1 (Advanced)
- Status tracking: Locked → In Progress → Completed
- Vocabulary and kanji targets for each level
- Progress bars showing how close you are to each level's requirements

### Study Streaks & Activity Tracking
- Automatic daily streak calculation
- Longest streak and total study days tracking
- Activity log with timestamped entries for all actions (add, edit, delete, import, export)

### GitHub-Style Activity Heatmap
- Visual calendar showing study activity intensity
- Color-coded cells from light to dark based on daily activity count
- Month and day-of-week labels for easy navigation

### Analytics Dashboard
- Vocabulary growth chart (line chart over time)
- Kanji growth chart (line chart over time)
- Resource completion chart (bar chart)
- Weekly activity breakdown (bar chart)
- JLPT level distribution with progress bars toward targets
- Configurable time range: Last 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, or all time

### Data Management
- **Export** all data as a JSON backup file
- **Import** data from a previously exported file with validation and preview
- **Reset** all data with double-confirmation safety (type "RESET" to confirm)
- Storage usage monitoring

### UI/UX
- **Dark Mode** — toggle between light and dark themes with persistent preference
- **Responsive Design** — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile with a slide-out sidebar
- **Keyboard accessible** — focus-visible styles, modal escape-to-close
- **Smooth animations** — fade-in, slide-up, and stagger effects
- **Custom scrollbars** — styled for WebKit and Firefox

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Markup | HTML5 |
| Styling | CSS3 (Custom Properties, Grid, Flexbox, Animations) |
| Logic | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), No frameworks or build tools |
| Storage | LocalStorage with a `StorageService` abstraction layer |
| Fonts | Inter (UI) + Noto Sans JP (Japanese text) via Google Fonts |

### Architecture

```
UI (HTML Templates)
  └→ Page Modules (render + init pattern)
      └→ StorageService (CRUD abstraction)
          └→ LocalStorage (browser persistence)
```

- **Render/Init Pattern** — Each page module exports a `render(storage)` function that returns HTML, and an `init(storage)` function that attaches event listeners after the DOM is painted
- **StorageService** — A class that wraps all LocalStorage operations with a `jlt_` key prefix, providing `getAll`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `search`, and `filter` methods
- **No Build Step** — All JS files are loaded via `<script>` tags in order; no bundler, transpiler, or package manager required

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishek-tanniru/Japanese-Learning-Tracker.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   ```bash
   # No server required — just open the file directly
   open index.html
   # or on Windows:
   start index.html
   ```

That's it. No dependencies, no build step, no `npm install`.

## How It Works

- All data is stored in your browser's **LocalStorage** (under the `jlt_` prefix)
- On first visit, the app seeds default learning resources and JLPT level definitions
- Navigate between pages using the sidebar — the URL hash updates (e.g., `#vocabulary`, `#kanji`)
- Export your data regularly as a backup — LocalStorage is browser-specific and doesn't sync across devices

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers — Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. No polyfills or transpilation required.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Backend API with Node.js/Express
- [ ] User authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Cloud sync across devices
- [ ] Database integration (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
- [ ] Spaced repetition system (SRS) for vocabulary and kanji
- [ ] JLPT practice test mode
- [ ] Audio pronunciation for vocabulary entries
- [ ] Furigana toggle for kanji readings
- [ ] PWA support with offline access
- [ ] Kanji radical breakdown view
